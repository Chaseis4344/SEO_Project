	  	<h2>Our Mission</h2><br/>
			<p>Our main mission and goal at Car To Sky is to bring about a revolution in how we perceive and view the way we travel, work, and exist. This is because we believe that the common everyday man was meant to fly, and not just on some expensive over-priced big budget airline. Our Mantra is "Perfect for you", we think that your car conversion and subsequent helicopter ride should expressly allow you to feel free and exuberant int the knowledge that our top-of-the-line technology has allowed you to soar, far above what an average person might. We believe in you.</p>
